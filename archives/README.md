Previous acronyms.tex found in other repositories are stored here for reference if only a selected listing of acronyms is needed or previous latex repos call out the name of either of these files specifically and do not want to be changed.

Adjustments / edits can be done of these files if needed, however, the [`combined-acronyms.tex`](../combined-acronyms.tex) should be used instead. Edits to these files will not adjust [`combined-acronyms.tex`](../combined-acronyms.tex) currently. Current files have duplicate acronyms in them and will lead to issues in latex generating repositories if they use both.
