# UASAL / acronyms
For storing the latest versions of acronyms for other repos to pull from. Contains original .tex files found in other repos and on Overleaf which are stored in the [archives](/archives) directory. Previous acronym related tex files were combined into one [combined-acronyms.tex](combined-acronyms.tex) file to potential limit the duplication of acronyms being added to multiple latex files leading to issues in compiling in workflows.

Rough script for generating a markdown file [combined-acronyms.md](combined-acronyms.md) from the [combined-acronyms.tex](combined-acronyms.tex) file provided as well but was a test script.

Results of the last latex to markdown conversion run shown below:
